# hello-world
Trying to figure out Github better with their Hello World intro.

My name is Stephen Rhoades.

I've used Github in the past to store my school programs, but i never really learned how to use it properly and just slapshod put the files up.
I'm hoping to further my experience in all things coding and figured that Github is one of the many things i should put effort into learning.
